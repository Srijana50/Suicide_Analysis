According to the WHO assessment about the suicide death between 2000-2016 is close to 800,000 every year which is one person every 40 seconds. I was curious to know about the reason behind self destruction and why the death rate is so high. Generally, most of us believe that people suicide because of the failure, proverty and the tradegy. Before starting this project, I was thinking the number of suicide teenages would be greater than other age group because of their incapability to take decision. Even some of popular and rich people also have choosen to kill them self at the peak of their career. Study shows that for each adult who deid by suicide there may have been more than 20 others attempting suicide. I decide to study the suicide trend and see whether there are any important factor which can help in suicide reduction.

This project was academic project and I had less than 2 month time period, I could not collect all the factors like education and mental health but I have tried to study about the impact of gender, generation, agegroup and gdp per capital in suicide.This is suicide Data analysis using python language from year 1985 to 2016.
